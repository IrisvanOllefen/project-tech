# Project Tech

This is the repository containing my research and made exercises. To see my final dating app feature, please visit [this repo](https://github.com/IrisvanOllefen/novel-love). If you want to immediately visit the website, which I deployed on Heroku, click [here](https://novel-love.herokuapp.com/).

## In this Repository, you will find:

- Exercises I made for backend. [click here to go to those exercises](https://github.com/IrisvanOllefen/project-tech/tree/master/backend-exercises)
- A very large Wiki where I documented every step of the way, placed summaries of things I read, watched and listened to and more! [click here to go to the wiki](https://github.com/IrisvanOllefen/project-tech/wiki)
